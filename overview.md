# What is ONLS?
 ONSL stands for Open Net Label Suite. It is a collection of tools (a "software suite") for creating a "net label" that presents and distributes media content, sort of like an art gallery, but on the interNET. All the software is open source, so anyone can start their own net label website.
 
 A net label has two main components: a "gallery" and a "studio". The gallery is a static website that is accessible by the public, and the studio is a private website from which one or more users can work, collaborate, and manage the gallery's appearance and content.

# Project Status
 As of July 16th, 2021, no code has been written, the idea exists entire in Doug's mind. He is still fleshing the idea out, and hopes to start developing the code for the studio web app soon.
