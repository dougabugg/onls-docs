# What is ONLS?
 ONSL stands for Open Net Label Suite. It is a collection of tools (a "software suite") for creating a "net label" that presents and distributes media content, sort of like an art gallery, but on the interNET. All the software is open source, so anyone can start their own net label website.
 
 A net label has two main components: a "gallery" and a "studio". The gallery is a static website that is accessible by the public, and the studio is a private website from which one or more users can work, collaborate, and manage the gallery's appearance and content.

# Inspiration for this project
 I wanted to create a tool to enable multiple users collaborate in a private space and publish a public "gallery" of content and media. The city I live in has a Makerspace with a wood working shop, metal shop, 3d printers, laser cutter, etc. However, they have a pretty basic website, I thought making it easier for members to document the various things they do and make there and publish them to our website, would help attract new members to the space. I have some past experience doing full stack web development, and thought this project would be a fun way to "get back in shape" and create something useful for the Makerspace I'm a member of!

# Project Status
 As of July 16th, 2021, no code has been written, the idea exists entirely in Doug's mind. He is still fleshing the idea out, and hopes to start developing the code for the studio web app soon.
 
 On October 11th, 2021, I am hoping to start working on a prototype soon.
